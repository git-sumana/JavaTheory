Servlets are Java classes that dynamically process and respond to requests made by clients in a web server environment.

without servlets:
Without servlets, a Java web application would lack server-side processing capabilities, making it impossible to handle user requests, process form submissions, or perform server-side logic, severely limiting its functionality and interactivity.

Platform Independence: Servlets are written in Java, which makes them platform-independent. They can run on any platform that supports Java, providing flexibility and portability.

Multithreading: Servlet containers manage servlet instances and handle multithreading internally. This means that servlets can handle multiple requests concurrently, improving performance and scalability.

Methods includes:
GET: Retrieves data from the server.
POST: Sends data to the server.
PUT: Updates data on the server.
DELETE: Removes data from the server.

LifeCycle:
init(), service(), destroy()

service():

This method is invoked by the servlet container to handle client requests.
Every time the servlet container receives a request for the servlet, it calls the service() method, passing in the request and response objects.

1. doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response):

This method is called by the servlet container to handle HTTP GET requests.
Developers override this method to implement the logic for processing GET requests.

2. doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response):

This method is called by the servlet container to handle HTTP POST requests.
Developers override this method to implement the logic for processing POST requests.

3. doPut(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response):

This method is called by the servlet container to handle HTTP PUT requests.
Developers override this method to implement the logic for processing PUT requests.

4. doDelete(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response):

This method is called by the servlet container to handle HTTP DELETE requests.
Developers override this method to implement the logic for processing DELETE requests.

destroy():

The destroy() method is called only once during the servlet's lifecycle, typically when the servlet container is shutting down or when the servlet is being redeployed.

init() initializes the servlet when it's first loaded into memory.
service() handles client requests, processing incoming requests and generating appropriate responses.
destroy() allows the servlet to perform cleanup tasks before it's removed from memory.
